Since I was a kid, I developed a strong aptitude for critical thinking and solving math problems. Later, when I got my first computer, I wanted to learn everything about it inside and out. I assembled my first computer from parts when I was 14 years old. I started to learn programming back then, but it was only a hobby for me at that time. Only later I decided to do computer programming professionally. Since then, I've been passionate about programming, and I've never considered occupying myself with anything else."),o.a.createElement(d,{title:"Family",src:"/assets/images/my_family_2.png",alt:"Family"},"My other passion is my family which consists of my beautiful wife and adorable little boy. These two people support me along the way and inspire me to achieve great things. They both believe in me and make me want to get out the bed in the morning. My happy family means a lot to me, and I wouldn't be able to achieve what I have in my life without them. Hopefully, when my son grows up, I will be able to pass my knowledge and experience about web development and computer programming to him."),o.a.createElement(c,{title:"Walters State Community College",src:"/assets/images/WSCC_copy_1.png",alt:"Walters State Community College photo"},"I started my formal computer programming education here at Walters State Community College. Here I was introduced to many programming languages and technologies. This is also where I've met a lot of smart people and  programmer friends. Walters State is where I was introduced to web and mobile development and also had a chance to work on real projects in both of these areas. I graduated from WSCC in 2018  with an associate degree in Computer Programming and a strong desire to continue my education in this field of study."),o.a.createElement(d,{title:"Arizona State University",src:"/assets/images/arizona-state-university.png",alt:"Arizona State University photo"},"I decided that I want to continue my education to improve my programming skills and also to learn some fundamentals of computer science such as Data Structures and Algorithms. So, I've chosen Arizona State University over the others for its credibility and adaptability of new technologies. Overall, ASU has been a great experience for me. Here I improved my math skills along with programming skills. I've also learnt a lot about operating systems and network communications which, I believe, made me a better web developer."),o.a.createElement(c,{title:"Soccer",src:"/assets/images/soccer.png",alt:"Ladychenko Denis Soccer Photo"},"I am also a big fan of different sports and outdoor activities, and soccer is my favorite one.
